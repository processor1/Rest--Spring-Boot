<h3>Spring Boot Rest</h3>
<p>Spring boot is fun to work with ,one of the widely used Java framework out there</p>
<p>This is very simple example of spring-boot application development with maven as build tool .</p>
<p>With spring-boot you don't need heavy xml configurations (you can leave that,because sprign-boot have default auto. configuration) which waste the developer time.</p>
<p>You can do much with spring-boot with no configuration at all, but to do application configuration concerning which port to run on or database configuration that can be done with application.properties file .</p>
